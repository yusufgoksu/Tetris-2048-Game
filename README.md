# Tetris-2048 Game

This project is a combination of two classic games: **Tetris** and **2048**.  
It was developed as a **school project** to demonstrate creativity in game mechanics and logic implementation.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

- Control falling Tetris pieces using arrow keys.
- When two blocks with the same number touch, they **merge into one** (like in 2048).
- Clear horizontal lines to keep the board from filling up.
- Your score increases with every successful merge or line clear.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yusufgoksu/Tetris-2048-Game.git
cd Tetris-2048-Game
python Tetris_2048.py
